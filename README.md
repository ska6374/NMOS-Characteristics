# N Channel MOSFET
A MOSFET is a three-terminal device in which the gate terminal is insulated from the channel by a silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer, therefore, it is also known as an insulated gate field effect transistor (IGFET), MOSFET works like a MOS capacitor which is controlled by the input gate to source voltage. That’s why MOSFET can also be used as a voltage-controlled capacitor.

<H2>I. Introduction</H2>
<br>
The N-Channel MOSFET Is a type of MOSFET. In the N channel MOSFET, the channel is composed of the majority of the electrons as current carriers. When the MOSFET is activated, the majority of current flows due to electrons moving through the channel. While in the other type of MOSFET (P channel MOSFET), the majority of current carriers are holes. Upon the substrate a silicon dioxide layer is also coated to provide electrical insulation and the metal top of the silicon dioxide layer makes the gate, source, and drain regions. It is also called NMOS. In the Next Part we will be going through Enhancement and Depletion type MOSFET.

<h2>II. Types of N-Channel MOSFET</h2>
On the basis of working, construction and Characteristics, The N-Channel MOSFET is classified in to two parts-<br>
i. N channel MOSFET.<br>
ii. P Channel MOSFET.<br>
<BR>
<H2>III. Advantages Of N-Channel MOSFET</H2><BR>
1. In the n-channel MOSFET mobility of electrons is greater the mobility of holes in the p-channel MOSFET.<BR>
2. It has better signal integrity.<BR>
3. It can handle the higher frequency operation.<BR>
4. It reduces the cross over distortion.<BR>
5. The NMOS is only transistor in which no isolation-island are required, that’s why high packing density is suitable for all logic families including VLSI, ULSI etc.<BR>
6. NMOS has large Fanout.<BR>
